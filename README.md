# suntzu

Sun Tzu is meant to be a security lifecycle system that assists in building a secure service at every stage. Upon inception, various components can be created, and those that the system knows about will offer guidance, as well as generic language security pointers. When a service has been created and the architecture updated within Sun Tzu, it will assist in threat modeling and more specific recommendations. Finally, it will have links for compliance and pentesting artifacts. TODOs will include ticketing integration.

## Project inception

When a team is creating a new service, it can initialize a new spot in SunTzu that will take generic info (team lead, repo, description, language, and generic components). Output will be a URL containing generic language and component security information for a service team to ignore.

TODO will be to put the components into a network diagram.

## Service creation

Once a service has been created, a selection within the UI will expand to a more detailed threat analysis baseline. 

TODO will be to output links to testing tools (code scanners, unit tests, etc)

TODO will be to include more detailed recommendations and a more specific diagram.

TODO will be to interface with a ticketing system to create tickets on discovered risks from the baseline.

## Compliance and pentesting

Annually, a ticket will be created for the baseline to be 're-upped' and reviewed (with historical reviews held in prior tabs). There will be input fields for links to compliance artifacts (code scan output, etc.), and pentest reporting.
